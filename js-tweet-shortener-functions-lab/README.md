# JavaScript Functions - Tweet Helper

## Instructions
Write a few functions to help up your Twitter game.

**Task #1** - Create a function called characterCounter that takes in one argument called phrase and returns the number of characters in phrase.

**Task #2** - Create a function called addHashtag that takes in one argument called tweet and returns the tweet with a `#yolo` added to the end of it.

**Task #3** - Create a function called tweetShortener that takes in one argument called tweet. The function should check to see how long the tweet is and if the tweet is less than 140 characters, it should return the tweet. If it is more than 140 characters, it should return only the first 140 characters. You'll want to learn how `substring()` works!

This lab has built in tests. 
To run them, cd into this directory and run npm install. 
Then open "index.html" in a browser. 
To re-run the tests, simply refresh your page. 
Initially, the tests will fail. 
Don't worry, failing tests are normal when you start a lab.
This just means that your code doesn't pass the specifications.

Put your solution code in "tweets.js" and get all tests to pass.
